# TimeGPT-Tabula9-RDL
In this project, I showcase TimeGPT for timeseries forecasting, Tabula9 and RelBench for Relational Deep Learning (RDL), mock data generation and inference.

## TimeGPT for TS Forecasting

TimeGPT is a 'foundation' model and library that can provide access to Nixtla's pre-trained TimeGPT model API. It is designed for quick (very little training) or 'zero shot' deep time series forecasting. It leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate and reliable predictions for various time-dependent data. 

## Tabula9 Library for RDL

Tabula9 is a powerful pre-trained relational or tabular 'foundation' model trained on a large set of data. It is designed to simplify the handling and manipulation of relational data for inference. It is popularly used to generate mock or synthetic data (built using the anonymized real data it has been trained on) for initializing a model tuned for a specific use-case.

## RelBench for RDL

RelBench is a neural network building library that can convert relational or tabular data into a graph or tree data structure format for use with a GNN (Graph Neural Network) using the Pytorch Geometric library. It also provides a standardized set of tasks and datasets to evaluate the performance and accuracy of various relational learning algorithms.
